README.md from fork
Written in java and utilizing Android Studio and Firebase Realtime DB, we created an app that allows users to manage sporting events.
As an admin user, you can:
* Create new venues for regular users to add events
* Approve/reject events requested by regular users
* View venues where regular users may sign up for events

As a regular user, you can:
* Make/request events (that await approval)
* Join events, assuming space permitting
